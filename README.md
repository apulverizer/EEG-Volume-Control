This package of Matlab functions, scripts, and data sets can be used to create and optimize SVM and RBFN classification algorithms.

1.  To run the project, run Project.m which is found in the Project directory.This script trains and predicts the classes for the data sets we have collected.

2.  To do real-time data processing run EEGVolumeControl.m which is found in the Project directory.

3.  These files are designed to work with a Windows 7 PC. The included BioSig toolbox is for 64bit OSes.

List of Directories:

    BioRadioMatlab - contains all the code to interface the BioRadio with Matlab in a real-time environment.
    
    biosig - contains the BioSig Toolbox
    
    Data Collection - contains the files that were recorded
    
    libsvm3-3.17 - contains the LIBSVM Toolbox
    
    Project - contains the main project script and GUI
    
    PSO - contains the PSO functions and scripts to optimize
    
    RBFN - contains the code for the RBFN
    
    TestData - contains standard data sets to verify classifiers
    
    VolumeControl - contains code which connects MATLAB to Windows 7 Volume
