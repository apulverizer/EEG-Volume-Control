===SetWindowsVolume.exe: 
A standalone program that, by default, sets the main Windows 7 volume control to 100% and unmutes it. 
A single float parameter between 0 and 1 will set the volume to between 0% and 100%.

===SetWindowsVolume.m: 
A Matlab program that calls SetWindowsVolume.exe




===SetMatlabVolume.m: 
By default sets to 100% and unmutes the Matlab aspect of Windows 7 volume control. 
But it's parametrically controllable, so can be used to set any percentage and/or unmute.
